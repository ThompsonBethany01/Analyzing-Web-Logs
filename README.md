# Analyzing-Web-Logs
## About the Project
### Goals
Find actionable information for upper management to present during the board meeting Thursday morning. 

### Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook documenting process to form conclusions
- One slide presentation on the most important findings that require immediate action / actionable insights

### Data Dictionary

### Questions Asked
- Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
- Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more that other cohorts seemed to gloss over? 
- Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students? 
- Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses? Any odd user-agents? 
- At some point in the last year, ability for students and alumni to cross-access curriculum (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before? 
- What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)? 
- Which lessons are least accessed?
